Welcome to MaRS-IITDMK Documentation
===================================

We are MaRS( Mars Rover Students) and are currently focusing on building autonomous UGVs (specifically rovers) and robotic arms. Our problem statement revolves around the exploration of inhabitable zones. Our goal is to build a system that can withstand any possible terrain. Currently, to reach our goals, we, Team SHUNYA, are participating in different rover challenges at the global level to train our systems. Recently, we secured the 2nd highest marks in Qualification A of ERC Remote 2023 Globally and the 1st in Asia.
